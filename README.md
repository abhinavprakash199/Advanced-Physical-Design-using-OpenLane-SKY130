# Advanced-Physical-Design-using-OpenLane-SKY130
This repository contains the whole summary of hands on done by Abhinav Prakash (IS22MTECH14002) during the workshop "Advanced-Physical-Design-using-OpenLane-SKY130" organised by VSD. The full RTL to GDSII flow was implemented for PICORV32A- a RISC-V based CPU core.

## Day 1
---

The day starts off with few sessions on:-
### Talking to Computers
---
- We are introduced to the internal structure of a computer using an example of a microcontroller board. 
- Terms like Board and chip design, Integrated circuits, die,packaging, IP and Foundry IP, and macros are explained.
- RISC-V instruction set architecture is introduced along with the mention of other popular architectures like ARM and x86. This is done because the design on which we are gonna work is RISC-V based picorv32a CPU core.
- An introduction to SoC is given i.e. what is a SoC, how is it laid out is explained using examples of processors, memories and IPs.

### SoC design and openLANE
---
The 3 important factors in ASIC design process are, 
1. RTL designs 
2. EDA tools 
3. Process design Kits (PDKs) 

And openLANE has made them OPENSOURCE !
